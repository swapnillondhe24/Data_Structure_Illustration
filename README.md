# Data_Structure_Illustration
In this mini project basic concepts of Data Structure are bound together in one main program
> An mini project for C++ language demonstrating the basic Data Strucuture Algorithms.
   I made it using C++ in JUNE 2018 for OOP (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING USING C++(22316)) at Amrutvahini Polytechnic.

### How To Install and Run the program.

* #### For Linux Users
> This project uses system calls to execute the precompiled executable of sub-programs.
  For execution on Linux system, user will need to recompile source to generate suitable ` .out ` files

* #### For Windows Users
    ```powershell
     git clone https://github.com/swapnillondhe24/Data_Structure_Illustration .\Data_Structure_Illustration
     cd Data_Structure_Illustration
     .\final_syn.exe
     ```
> _This project was entirely build using **[Dev-C++](https://bloodshed-dev-c.en.softonic.com/download)** IDE_
